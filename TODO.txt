Update mapper to be MMC1  (done)
Update linker to obey new mapper stuff (done)
Move cutscene into its own files. (done)
Call cutscene code from C code. (done)
Update initialization code (init mapper, etc..)
Add ASM routines for screen loading
Update C code to load in initial screens
Adding level loading code.
Able to load level tiles and palette
Load Columns into RAM.
Add level constants to a level table (to more easily support additional levels later)
Able to load the first 2 nametables and their OAM.
Able to do split screen scrolling (fixed top status bar)
