Completed activitied for CC65 conversion
-----------------------------------------

Get project to compile without errors (done but nothing works)
Update mapper to be MMC1  (done)
Update linker to obey new mapper stuff (done)
Move cutscene into its own files. (done)
Call cutscene code from C code. (done)
Update initialization code (init mapper, etc..)
Add ASM routines for screen loading
Update C code to load in initial screens
Adding level loading code.
Able to load level tiles and palette
Load Columns into RAM.
Add level constants to a level table (to more easily support additional levels later)
Able to load the first 2 nametables and their OAM.
Able to do split screen scrolling (fixed top status bar)
Able to smooth scroll (swapping nametables when the overlap occurs)
Figured out a workaround for ppu_waitnmi so I can do split screen and still have dynamic updates
Fixed Dynamic OAM loading for collumns



Feb 10th.  Got player clipping working (1 point.  Still need mid and max points too)
           Changed to add some player bounds.
           Added DEV_MODE up/down controls
           BROKEN: Does not factor properly when scrolled (ie: calculating collision against column 35  it might think its 3

Feb 11th: Fixed proper scroll - collision code to properly intersect horizontally against correct collision formula
