driver.bin built from the Famitracker driver 2.0 from Famitracker.shoodot.net

http://famitracker.shoodot.net/downloads.php
NSF driver source v2.0

Assembled using:
	ca65 driver.s -D DRIVER_MODE -D MODE1 --listing
	ld65 -C clean.cfg -o driver.bin driver.o -v -m map.txt


We may include the source for this into the project at some stage to baseline the version?
