NES side scrolling platform engine written mostly in CC65


Porting this to a GIT environment is still a work in progress.   Previously all the tools were running in cygwin.
I will update this README as I get things working in a GIT world.

Getting started
================

The following tools are required:
 - CC65
 - ANT

Building
=========
ant     (this runs the ant build script)
